    <p>She had a father who was lost at the sea. After her mother remarriages a king, Sofia becomes royal. Being new to the world, Princess Sofia attends the Royal Prep Academy where Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather show her the ropes about what being a Princess is all about. However, a mishappening occurred when Sofia was caught between two messages: First - Is being a Princess about material goods or having a good heart? Second: It is up to her animals, led by Clover the rabbit, and a powerful, magical lucky charm, to set her on the path of the heart.
        The Sofia Story
        <p>Princess Sofia is the titular protagonist of the series named, Sofia the First. She is a young girl with a commoner's heritage till her mom marries the King of Enchancia and became a princess. Sofia learns that searching like a princess is not all that hard, however behaving as one can come only from the heart.</p>
        
        <p>Sofia is proven to have a -sided character: One aspect is that of a softhearted idealist. Sofia is proven to be very kind and compassionate. She is likewise proven to be loyal to her loved ones to the point of altruism. She is likewise inclined to befriend people the large majority refuse to have something to do with. She additionally believes in keeping promises regardless of what. She additionally suggests her affections by giving her loved ones warm hugs. She also believes that something being trouble-free and being satisfied with something are identical things.</p>
        
        <center><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ1TJiR7NyFTUxrs28G16TPnnQnemSlm3VvYw&usqp=CAU" alt="" ></center>
        <p>The other aspect of her character is that of a hard-headed pragmatist. Sofia is proven to be a precocious woman who believes the proof is in the pudding. This fuels an aspect of her this is very investigative and skeptical. She has a tendency to try to juggle more than she can handle, especially when it comes to her friends and values making herself as multifaceted as possible. This aspect additionally offers her trust issues that make her burst off on her own without telling anybody and hold secrets from everyone except her Aunt Tilly and her mermaid friend Princess Oona.</p>
        <p>There is a smaller third part of Sofia's character that she attempts to hide: Her prone, scared, and concerned part. In many instances, Sofia's prone side has made her question if she truly belongs with her royal friends and family. She has a tendency to fear her own self-confidence and if she can handle being a princess. While she does not get scared frequently, while she does she will lose some of her confidence, which can reason problems for her.</p>
        <p>Sofia is a lovely younger woman with fair skin, rosy cheeks, thin pink lips, mild blue eyes, and  long hair (that she once in a while ties in a ponytail).</p>
        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSZWGZJi-6kOWZwhWDTfZQYq_IMTyMOXYUsqA&usqp=CAU" alt="">
        <p>She usually wears a lilac queen gown with telltale signs of jewels down on the front and all along the nape of the neck as well as wings at the dress, a jewel as well as a richly decorated lilac petaled skirt with such an array of incredible lace drops and trumpets every one of them positioned like a four-leaf clover or cross on a nimbus, and a yellowish petticoat with a lilac band; a swirly tiara inset Her debutante ball gown included intricate lacework.</p>
        <p>During Elena and the Secret of Avalor, her amulet has become pink and her dresses turned into a violet robe while she was a commoner, her Derby outfit, and sorceress robe, wherein her bodice now has white vines on a pink front among the only lines of pearls each clustered with 8 smaller pearls and her sheer overskirt has shafts of 4 spade-like pairs of tendrils in opposition to beams all greater below the next over 15 drops organized as daisy petals over the violet skirt with three white fan stripes among every shaft. She additionally wears purple slippers and white stockings. But in advance, the Disney websites featured her in an intermediate glittery outfit of the crimson skirt with opalescent clover-nimbus motif, pink petticoat, violet bow-tie slippers, and stockings and a purple amulet, which she did not put on in the crossover, however more frequently in the episodes since "The Bamboo Kite". So each of her unique clothing in the tv specials did not emerge as employed often as opposed to the simpler ones. Sofia's promotional art and products broadly depart from the dress and amulet.</p>
        <p> When she is going on outings, she usually wears a violet equestrian suit for riding, a cap with a bow, a jacket, trousers, and boots, however, her blouse is lilac like her flying horse, Minimus. When she has a Buttercups assembly she wears what basically looks as if a Girl Scouts uniform of the 1960s which, just like the Fireside Girls in Phineas and Ferb, has a beret with emblem, blouse, and skirt right here of shades of yellow. However, uniform tan emblem vests, brown shoes, and red socks were worn. A green or red backpack has been worn by each Buttercup.</p>

        <p>Otherwise, when Sofia travels on foot she wears an extended dress with three stripes on the bottom, a thick coat, once in a while a bow, and a narrow-brimmed hat with a head strap and a band with her tiara emblem.</p>
        <p>However, Sofia's amulet allows her to change the size of a rodent or wee sprite or right into a mermaid, on every occasion she desires to. Her authentic mermaid design has a violet tail, lilac pinnacle with sheer waist frill, bra of numerous pink scallop shells and an amethyst-beaded strap, a bracelet of starfish, and seashells, and golden tiara of stars, a couple of seahorses, and a few gems. Her mermaid redesign has a tail with an exclusive color of purple, a pink pinnacle with white frills at the neckline, a sash of red-violet seaweed around her waist, pink fins, and a gold and pink seashell tiara.</p>
        <p> Hence, the Sofia story took us to the imaginary world where everything seemed to be thrilling and adventurous</p>
