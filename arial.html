<h2 style="color:black;">Ariel (The Little Mermaid):</h2>
<p>Ariel is a fictional character in the Walt Disney Pictures 28th animated feature film The Little Mermaid (1989). Ariel is voiced by Jodi Benson in all official animated appearances and merchandise. The fourth Disney Princess, Ariel is the youngest daughter of King Triton and Queen Athena of an underwater kingdom of merfolk called Atlantica.[5][6] She is often rebellious, and in the first film, she longs to be a part of the human world. She marries Prince Eric, whom she rescued from a shipwreck, and together they have a daughter, Melody.[7] She is the first Disney Princess to be developed during the Disney Renaissance.</p>
<p>The character is based on the title character of Hans Christian Andersen's 1837 fairy tale "The Little Mermaid" but was developed into a different personality for the 1989 animated film adaptation. Ariel has received a mixed reception from critics; some publications such as Time criticize her for being too devoted to Eric whereas others, such as Empire, praise the character for her rebellious personality, a departure from previous Disney Princesses' roles. Halle Bailey portrays a live-action version of the character in the 2023 live-action adaptation of the original 1989 film.</p>
<p>Ariel first appears in The Little Mermaid (1989), in which she is shown as being adventurous and curious about the world of humans, a fascination which annoys both her father King Triton and his court composer Sebastian, as merfolk are not allowed to make contact with the human world. She and Flounder go in search of human objects, which they take to a seagull named Scuttle for appraisal. Ariel falls in love with a human prince named Prince Eric after saving him from drowning, and visits the sea witch, Ursula, who agrees to turn her into a human in exchange for her voice. Ariel must make Prince Eric fall in love with her and romantically kiss her within three days, lest she belong to Ursula forever.
Unknown to Ariel, this agreement is part of Ursula's bigger plan to trap Ariel's father, King Triton and steal his magical trident. After being transformed, Ariel found that she can no longer breathe, nor swim. Sebastian and Flounder take her to the surface. She is soon found by Eric and is taken back to his castle. Ariel almost manages to obtain the "kiss of true love", but is stopped by Ursula's underhanded tactics. On the second day, Ursula transforms herself into a human, calling herself "Vanessa" and using Ariel's voice, bewitches Eric to make him marry her on the third day. After learning from Scuttle that the woman is Ursula in disguise, Ariel disrupts the wedding and regains her voice, but the sun sets as Ariel and Prince Eric are about to kiss, transforming Ariel back into a mermaid. After transforming herself back into her true witch form, Ursula takes Ariel back into the ocean, where she is met by King Triton and Sebastian.
Triton trades himself for Ariel, enabling Ursula to steal his crown and enabling her to claim his trident, which angers Ariel, who will not allow Ursula to destroy merfolk and humans. In the battle that follows, Ariel is trapped at the bottom of a whirlpool. Before Ursula can kill her, Eric impales Ursula with a derelict ship's splintered prow. After Ursula dies, her spell is broken, and King Triton and the merfolk are transformed back to normal merpeople. At the end of the film, after King Triton uses his magical trident to transform Ariel into a human, she leaves the sea to live in the human world. She and Eric marry and live happily ever after.</p>

<h1>Ariel Mermaid Disney Princess</h1>
<p>Once upon a time, deep under the sea lived a redheaded beautiful young mermaid named Ariel. She was a curious and adventurous little mermaid, who loved exploring her home city of Atlantica with her companions. Some days she wondered what life as a human living on land would be like. Because of her fascination with the human world, she would often swim up to shore with her friend Flounder to find human treasures.</p>
<h1>King Triton Was Angry </h1>
<p>Ariel's father, King Triton, did not trust humans and thought that they were dangerous and unsafe. He did not like Ariel’s trip close to the shore. He found out that she had once again disobeyed him and gone to the shore. He was furious. He banned her from going to the shore ever again and asked a Lobster named Sebastian, who was his greatest advisor, to keep an eye on the rebellious green-tailed mermaid.
